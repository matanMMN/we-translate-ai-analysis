1. What Relert is and what it is used for 

Relert contains the active substance eletriptan. Relert is one of a group of medicines called serotonin receptor agonists. Serotonin is a natural substance found in the brain that helps to narrow the blood vessels. 

Relert can be used to treat migraine headache with or without aura in adults. Before the start of a migraine headache, you may experience a phase called an aura, which can involve vision disorders, numbness and speech disorders. 


2. What you need to know before you take Relert
Do not take Relert: 
•	If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to eletriptan, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
•	If you have severe liver or kidney disease. 
•	If you have moderate to severe high blood pressure or untreated mild high blood pressure. 
•	If you have ever had heart problems, [e.g. heart attack, angina, heart failure or significant abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), temporary, sudden narrowing of one of the coronary arteries]. 
•	If you have poor circulation (peripheral vascular disease).
•	If you have ever had a stroke (even a mild one that lasted for only a few minutes or hours). 
•	If you have taken ergotamine or medicines like ergotamine (including methysergide) within 24 hours before or after taking Relert.
If you are taking any other medicines that end in ‘triptan’ (for example sumatriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan, almotriptan and frovatriptan). 

Please consult your doctor and do not take Relert, if these statements apply to you now or have applied to you at any time in the past. 
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Relert if:
•	you have diabetes. 
•	you smoke or use nicotine replacement therapy. 
•	you are male and over 40 years. 
•	you are female and post-menopausal. 
•	you or anybody in your family have coronary artery disease. 
•	you have ever been told that you may have an increased risk of heart disease, discuss this with your doctor before using Relert. 

Repeat use of migraine medicines 
If you repeatedly use Relert or any medicines for the treatment of migraine over several days or weeks, this can cause daily long-term headaches.  Tell your doctor if you experience this as you might need to stop treatment for a while. 
Other medicines and Relert
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 

Taking Relert together with some medicines may cause serious side effects.  Do not use Relert if: 
•	you have taken ergotamine or medicines like ergotamine (including methysergide) within 24 hours before or after taking Relert.
•	you are taking any other medicines that end in ‘triptan’ (for example sumatriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan, almotriptan and frovatriptan). 

Some medicines can affect the way Relert works, or Relert itself can reduce the effectiveness of other medicines taken at the same time. These include: 
•	Drugs used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole and itraconazole). 
•	Drugs used to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin and josamycin). 
•	Drugs used to treat AIDS and HIV (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and nelfinavir). 

The herbal preparation St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) should not be taken at the same time as this medicine. If you already take St John’s wort, consult your doctor before stopping the St John’s wort preparation. 
Tell your doctor before starting treatment with eletriptan, if you are taking some medicines (commonly referred to as SSRIs* or SNRIs**), for depression and other mental disorders. These medicines may increase the risk of developing serotonin syndrome during combined use with certain migraine medications. See Section 4 Possible Side Effects for more information on the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. 
*SSRIs- Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors **SNRIs Serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors

3. How to take Relert 

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 

Adults 
Your medicine can be taken at any time after the start of the migraine headache, but it is best to take it as soon as possible. However you should only take Relert during the headache phase of the migraine. You should not take this medicine to prevent a migraine attack. 
•	The usual starting dose is one 40 mg tablet. 
•	Swallow each tablet whole with a drink of water. 
•	If the first tablet does not relieve your migraine, do not take a second tablet for the same attack. 
•	If after a first tablet your migraine is relieved and then comes back, you may take a second tablet. However, after taking the first tablet you must wait at least 2 hours before taking the second tablet. 
•	You should not take more than 80 mg (2 x 40 mg tablets) within 24 hours. 
•	If you find that a dose of one 40 mg tablet does not relieve your migraines, tell your doctor – he or she may decide to increase the dose to two 40 mg tablets for future attacks.
